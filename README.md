# Monopoly-Probability
According to a few sources online, Illinois Avenue is the most frequently landed-on square in monopoly. This application serves to either prove or disprove that statement by simulating 100,000 games of Monopoly, counting the number of times each tile is landed on, and sending the information to a database the keeps tally of every tile that has been landed on in every trial.

It's too bad Heroku no longer offers free dynos, because that was a pretty important part for the global tally functionality. It still works locally though for 100,000 iterations though.
